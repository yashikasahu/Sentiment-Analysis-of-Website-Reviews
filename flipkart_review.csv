Overall the beast ❤️"
"Awesome and superb!
Upgraded from iPhone 12 to 16pro after 4 years. Display is awesome and bigger , the bezel is much slimmer , dedicated camera control feature with swipe feature and changes of exposure is superb and quick. Lighter weight even. Overall an excellent one . Definitely can go for it 🫶👍🤍"

Awesome iPhone. Good upgrade from iPhone 13. Love the 4K 120.
"I was having iPhone XR from 5yrs , i exchanged it with this demon 😈 , I got very good exchange bonus and the 16pro is very good for night clicks , 48 mp dslr like pictures, performance is also very good , battery will come around 1 day compare to my old xr mobile."
