Upgraded from iPhone 12 to 16pro after 4 years. Display is awesome and bigger , the bezel is much slimmer , dedicated camera control feature with swipe feature and changes of exposure is superb and quick. Lighter weight even. Overall an excellent one . Definitely can go for it 🫶👍🤍",Positive,0.9993382096290588,0.5533333333333333
